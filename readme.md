# Automated Generation of Optimisation Algorithms
The aim of this project is to create a generalised framework for inducing and optimising decision trees.
Given a dataset, we will form a decision tree and then optimise that tree to achieve greater performance in terms of a specified objective function. (i.e. accuracy of the model, size of the tree)
This project aims to create a generalised framework for producing interpretable decision trees from multivariate data, as well as being capable of producing highly accurate classification models.
